### E-Authentication System with QR Code and Email Verification  

**Overview:**  
This project implements a secure and efficient e-authentication system using Java, SQL, and popular Java frameworks. The system provides dual-layer authentication through QR code validation and email verification, ensuring enhanced security and reliability.

**Features:**  
- **QR Code Authentication:**  
  Generates a unique QR code for user identity verification.  
- **Email Verification:**  
  Sends a verification link or code to the userâ€™s registered email for added security.  
- **Database Management:**  
  Uses JDBC to connect and interact with a SQL database for user data storage and authentication logs.  
- **Java Frameworks:**  
  Integrates Spring or Hibernate for a modular and scalable backend architecture.  
- **Secure Operations:**  
  Implements robust encryption for sensitive data and exception handling for seamless functionality.

**Technology Stack:**  
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Frameworks:** Spring/Hibernate, JSP, Servlets  
- **Database:** SQL  
- **Connectivity:** JDBC  
- **QR Code Library:** ZXing (or similar)  
- **Email Service:** JavaMail API  

**How It Works:**  
1. User initiates the authentication process by entering their credentials.  
2. A unique QR code is generated and displayed for scanning.  
3. Simultaneously, a verification email is sent to the registered email address.  
4. User completes authentication by scanning the QR code or verifying through the email link/code.  
5. Upon successful verification, the system grants access.  

**Setup Instructions:**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository-url>  
   ```  
2. Set up a SQL database and configure JDBC connection details in the project.  
3. Configure email settings in the `application.properties` file (e.g., SMTP details).  
4. Build and run the project using your preferred Java IDE.
